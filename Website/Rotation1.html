                            <h4>Our Takeaways...</h4>
                            <p>Information Governance Privacy and Security focuses on three main matters: people, processes, and technology. During their second rotation, Danielle and Jaylin learned how the IGPS team provides clients with these matters in order to reduce risk, secure data, and improve the e-discovery process. Danielle and Jaylin like to think of IGPS as the proactive work that reduces a company's risk of litigation. In other words, the IG team works with clients to organize their data and keep up with state and country laws to ensure an easy retrieval of information when the inevitable threat of litigation appears. Danielle enjoyed learning about ad technology the most. She was fascinated by how data trusts work and noticed the importance of the privacy laws associated with such detailed consumer data. Furthermore, Danielle and Jaylin learned about the importance of a company's email retention policy as this is an important factor in properly storing important data and disposing of old or redundant data to reduce storage cost and lower company risk. Andrew Shaxted introduced Danielle and Jaylin to privacy engineering and gave them book suggestions to advance their learning, meanwhile Rayvon Dean introduced the FLInterns to data deduplication and gave them the opportunity to look over and identify redundant data. Danielle can see herself pursuing a career in this space and hopes to further educate herself in this field.  </p>

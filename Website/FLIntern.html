                            <h4>A FLIntern Is...</h4>
                            <p>A FLIntern is a rising junior interested in advancing his/her/their career through a rotational program in a particular field of study. Given their technical background, Danielle and Jaylin participated in the FTI Tech rotation. During their time at FTI Danielle and Jaylin learned about Digital Forensics, Information Governance Privacy and Security, and Document Database Services. Additionally, the FLInterns participated in weekly workshops orchestrated by the FTI Early Talent Team which introduced Danielle and Jaylin to important topics and insights as they related to starting a successful career. Danielle and Jaylin actively participated in the following workshops: Building Your Brand, Evaluating an Offer, and Engaging the Next Generation of Diverse Professionals. Danielle and Jaylin greatly enjoyed the FLInternship Program, although they do wish they could be with the FTI Tech team longer! </p>

<div class="Workshops">
<h4> FLIntern Workshops:</h4>
<p>The first FLIntern Workshop that Danielle and Jaylin participated in was entitled Building Your Brand. In this workshop, the FLInterns discussed how they can use their strengths to advance their careers and make up for what they potentially lack in their weaknesses. Furthermore, they discussed the importance of being honest with yourself about what you want your career to look like. The second workshop was called Evaluating An Offer. The FLInterns learned that there is more to an offer than just the yearly salary and that it is important to think about employee benefits such as healthcare, PTO, maternity/paternity leave etc. The final workshop that Danielle and Jaylin attended was Engaging the Next Generation of Diverse Professionals. In this workshop, the FLInterns shared their thoughts on what struggles may be presented to them in their future and how to mitigate these challenges. Moreover, they discussed how everyone brings something special and unique to the professional world and that it is important to market yourself and network with other professionals to build a strong career. </p>

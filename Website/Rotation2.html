                            <h4>Our Takeaways...</h4>
                            <p>During their DDS rotation, Danielle and Jaylin learned the process of eDiscovery. This process typically includes data collection, data extraction, data processing into a database, culling data in Relativity, reviewing data, and finally, producing data. Danielle and Jaylin met with people across the DDS practice which included eDiscovery team members, acuity team members, and case management team members. Furthermore, Danielle and Jaylin discussed the EDRM during their interviews. They learned how the reference model was applied in order to take unstructured data and organize it and query it for lawyers. It is very important that the DDS consultants have reliable text from text extraction. Additionally, Deedra Smith graciosuly added Danielle and Jaylin to a project chat for their Project Grille case. This case is a second request for a healthcare company that is merging with another company. Currently, the team is going through the process of combining the documents and records of the two companies. After Danielle spoke with the intern assigned to the case, she was able to gather an understanding of the team dynamic of an eDiscovery case.    </p>

                            <h4>Our Takeaways...</h4>
                            <p>Digital Forensics was the Danielle and Jaylin's first rotation of the FLIntern program. They believe that DFOR was the best way to begin the program as it was the most technical practice they rotated through and both Danielle and Jaylin enjoy using their technical skills. After rotating through DFOR, Danielle and Jaylin found that some of the complex topics they learn in school are applicable to this field. For example, we learned about hashing algorithms in our discrete math classes. We found that hashing algorithms can be used to accomplish authentication and prove that evidence has not been tampered with. Furthermore, the FLInterns had the chance to image an iPhone during their time in DFOR. Alongside Kevin Leong, Danielle and Jaylin imaged and preserved the data on the phone to learn how the edit and unsend features of Apple's new OS is visualized from a digital forensic's standpoint. Digital Forensics was Jaylin's favorite rotation. He enjoyed this practice the most because he felt that it showed a strong correlation to material that he already learned in school. After speaking with many individuals from the Digital Forensics sector, Jaylin saw himself in that position.  </p>

                            <li>Having the ability to articulate intentions to a client in an understandable manner as some custodians do not have a technical background</li>
                            <li>  Having the ability to adapt to last minute travel plans--- Some consultants keep an emergency travel bag at their desk! </li>
